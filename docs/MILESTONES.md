- #8: Fix brainrots glitching through floor (BUG - critical)

## ✨ Milestone 3: Content & Polish

**Goal:** Visual polish, animations, content expansion

## Testing Workflow

**When agent completes:**
1. Basilisk pings you: "Issue #X ready - Test: [specific instructions]"
2. You playtest in Roblox Studio
3. Reply: "Pass" or "Fail: [what's wrong]"
4. Pass → Basilisk merges, closes issue, spawns next agent
5. Fail → Basilisk adds feedback, respawns agent on same issue
