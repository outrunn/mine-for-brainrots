# Rebirth Progression System

**20 rebirths. Every one changes how you play.**

---

## How Rebirths Work

- Player levels Shaft (speed) and Head (power) using coins
- Both stats must reach a gate level to rebirth
- On rebirth: stats reset to 0, currency and ore wiped
- Permanent reward granted that never goes away
- Pickaxes, squares, multipliers, gacha tiers — all persist forever

---

## Starting State

| What | Value |
|------|-------|
| Pickaxe | Wooden (T0) — layers 1-4 only, 1 block per swing |
| Collector Squares | 1 active (7 locked on base) |
| Brainrot Income Mult | 1.0x |
| Gacha Access | Basic only (500 coins) |
| Daily Spins | 5 |
| Brainrot Level Cap | 10 |
| Auto-Collect | No (manual pickup) |
| Tycoon Phase | Phase 1 (pads 1-10) |

## Progression Tracks Summary

### Pickaxe Tiers (earned at rebirths)

| Tier | Name | Rebirth | Layers | Multi-Mine | What Opens Up |
|------|------|---------|--------|------------|---------------|
| T0 | Wooden | Start | 1-4 | 1 | Grass, dirt, stone |
| T1 | Stone | **R1** | 1-6 | 1 | Coal (5/block) |
| T2 | Iron | **R4** | 1-10 | **2** | Redstone (15), Gold (40) |
| T3 | Gold | **R8** | 1-14 | 2 | Diamond (100) |
| T4 | Diamond | **R12** | 1-17 | **3** | Deep diamond layers |
| T5 | Obsidian | **R20** | 1-20 | **4** | Full pit, deepest ores |

Pickaxes are NOT purchasable. They are only earned through rebirths.

### Collector Squares (1 -> 8)

| Squares | Rebirth | NPC Capacity |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Start | 1 brainrot |
| 2 | **R2** | 2 brainrots |
| 3 | **R3** | 3 brainrots |
| 4 | **R6** | 4 brainrots |
| 5 | **R9** | 5 brainrots |
| 6 | **R13** | 6 brainrots |
| 7 | **R17** | 7 brainrots |
| 8 | **R19** | 8 brainrots (MAX) |

Squares are spread across all 20 rebirths. Each new square feels impactful because the player has better brainrots to fill it with.

### Brainrot Income Multiplier

| Multiplier | Rebirth | Effect |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 1.0x | Start | Base NPC income |
| 1.5x | **R7** | All NPCs earn 50% more |
| 2.0x | **R14** | All NPCs earn double |
| 2.5x | **R18** | All NPCs earn 2.5x |

Multiplier applies to ALL deployed brainrots. Stacks with rarity, level, and square count.

### Gacha Tiers

| Tier | Cost | Rebirth | Min Rarity | Best Feature |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Basic | 500 | Always | Common | Cheap, good for building collection |
| Premium | 2,500 | **R10** | **Uncommon** | No Commons! 20% Epic, 10% Legendary |
| Ultra | 10,000 | **R16** | **Rare** | No trash! 25% Legendary, 10% Mythic |

### Other Unlocks

| Unlock | Rebirth | What It Does |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Auto-Collect | **R5** | NPCs deposit earnings automatically |
| +1 Daily Spin | **R11** | 6 spins/day instead of 5 |
| Brainrot Level Cap 15 | **R15** | Upgrade brainrots past level 10 |

### Tycoon Phases (bonus, not a rebirth reward)

| Phase | Rebirth | Pads | Highlights |
|-------|---------|------|-----------|
| Phase 1: Basic | R0+ | 1-10 | Walls, floor, lighting, ore conveyor |
| Phase 2: Workshop | R5+ | 11-17 | Dynamite, chimney, Layer 5 portal |
| Phase 3: Factory | R10+ | 18-24 | Jetpack, portals L10/L15, big dynamite |
| Phase 4: Elite | R15+ | 25-30 | Nuclear fuse, L18 portal, turbo jetpack, penthouse |

## Stat Gates & Cost

Stats reset every rebirth. Cost formula: `floor(50 * 1.8 ^ (level - 1))`

| Gate | Both Stats Cost | Used By |
|------|----------------|---------|
| S5/H5 | 2,238 | R1 |
| S6/H6 | 4,128 | R2 |
| S7/H7 | 7,530 | R3 |
| S8/H8 | 13,654 | R4, R5 |
| S9/H9 | 24,678 | R6, R7 |
| S10/H10 | 44,522 | R8, R9 |
| S11/H11 | 80,240 | R10, R11 |
| S12/H12 | 144,534 | R12, R13 |
| S13/H13 | 260,262 | R14, R15 |
| S14/H14 | 468,574 | R16, R17 |
| S15/H15 | 843,534 | R18, R19, R20 |

**Quick doubles:** R5, R7, R9, R11, R13, R15, R17 share their gate with the previous rebirth. These are fast wins — the player just earned a big upgrade and can immediately rebirth again at the same stat level.

**Triple finale:** R18, R19, R20 all need S15/H15. Three incredible rewards back to back.

---

## Why Each Reward Is Where It Is

| Reward Type | Design Rationale |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Pickaxes at R1, R4, R8, R12, R20** | Spaced evenly across the journey. Each one opens new layers AND increases multi-mine. R20 is the ultimate prize. |
| **Squares at R2, R3, R6, R9, R13, R17, R19** | Front-loaded early (R2, R3) so the player builds their army fast. Spaced wider later when each square is filled with better brainrots. |
| **Income mult at R7, R14, R18** | Placed AFTER the player gets new squares, so the multiplier applies to more NPCs. Each one is a noticeable jump. |
| **Auto-Collect at R5** | QoL reward on a quick-double. Player just got T2 pickaxe and can immediately enjoy auto-collect. Two great things in rapid succession. |
| **Premium Gacha at R10** | Midpoint reward. Player has 5 squares to fill — Premium helps them get Epics/Legendaries to fill those slots. |
| **Ultra Gacha at R16** | Endgame. Player has 6-7 squares and needs Legendaries/Mythics. Ultra delivers. |
| **Level Cap at R15** | Player has 2.0x income and 6 squares. Upgrading brainrots to L15 makes the existing army stronger before adding more squares. |
| **+1 Spin at R11** | Small but welcome. Quick-double reward that adds daily value without being too powerful. |
